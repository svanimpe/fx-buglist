# Bug List

This example replaced <a href="https://github.com/svanimpe/fx-ogly">Ogly</a> in my JavaFX workshops. It covers the same topics but adds layout panes. 

## fx:root

Unlike Ogly, I did not rework this example to use the `fx:root` construct. While I do recommend using `fx:root`, I wanted to keep examples of both approaches online so you can compare them side by side.

This example also contains a handcoded version of the GUI. To really understand JavaFX, I recommend you start by building all your GUIs in code and only start using FXML when you understand how everything fits together.

This repository contains a NetBeans project. It was last tested using NetBeans 8.0.2 and JDK 8u25.
